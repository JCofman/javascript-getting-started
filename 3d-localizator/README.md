# 3D Localizator

This is example of using [@cognite/gearbox](https://github.com/cognitedata/gearbox.js) library.
The app demonstrates use of following components: `Model3DViewer`, `AssetSearch`, `AssetScanner` and `TenantSelector` for selecting a project.</br>
`Cognite React-Auth` [@cognite/react-auth](https://github.com/cognitedata/react-auth) has been used to handle authentication.
You have to log into a tenant (project) that has some uploaded 3D models to leverage `Model3DViewer` component.
